Yesterday when I was browsering red note, a man comment on my post, suggesting that I should sit IELTS exam. This, he implied, will help me secure admission to summer vacations of "Hua Wu". It was not the first time I recieved such advice on posts where sought opinions regarding postgraduate admission recommendations. Despite possessing a solid research background, which ostensibly gives me a competitve edge for pursing postgraduate stuides at prestigious universities, I have yet pass the CET-6 exam. This test is widely regarded as a minimum threshould for consideration by these top-tier institution.

While lying in bed last night, I made a firm decision: I need to sit the IELTS exam and achieve a minimum score of 6.0. Consequently, I downloaded an app designed for vocabulary memorization and learned 30 new words yesterday, staying up until 1 a.m. to do so.
