I found the an advantage of reading English articles. 
Concepts whose real meaning you don't yet fully grasp will become more **aparent** through English reading, **whereas** they might be overlooked in Chinese, enven when they **conveying** the same way. 
Professional terms in Chinese can sometimes create a **deceptive sense of similarity**. 
**For instance**, when reading a sentence like“通过扩散器的透射和粗糙表面的反射，可以重建出清晰的图像。”, the professional term is "扩散器“.
However, because it's constituent parts, “扩散” and “器”, appear easily understandable, my mind might overlook the complete term and move to next sectence. 
But I don't understand that word and it real meaning actually. However, that word written by English will be fabriced to one vocabulary: diffuser, and seperated by other words in sentence. It seems like insert 空格 into Chinese sentence to make it converts to “通过 扩散器 的 透射 和 粗糙 表面 的 反射”. Once the key word seperated by this way, you will notice the whole word "扩散器“ and realize that you don't know it's meaning. This is what English actually do.
