I found the an advantage of reading English articles. 
Concepts whose real meaning you don't yet fully grasp will become more **aparent** through English reading, **whereas** they might be overlooked in Chinese, enven when they **conveying** the same way. 
Professional terms in Chinese can sometimes create a **deceptive sense of similarity**. 
**For instance**, when reading a sentence like“通过扩散器的透射和粗糙表面的反射，可以重建出清晰的图像。”, the professional term is "扩散器“.
However, because it's **constituent** parts, “扩散” and “器”, appear easily understandable, my mind might overlook the complete term and move to next sectence. 
**In reality, however,** I don't actually understand that word and its true meaning.
But I don't understand that word and it real meaning actually. However, that word written by English will be fabriced to one vocabulary: diffuser, and seperated by other words in sentence. It seems like insert 空格 into Chinese sentence to make it converts to “通过 扩散器 的 透射 和 粗糙 表面 的 反射”. Once the key word seperated by this way, you will notice the whole word "扩散器“ and realize that you don't know it's meaning. This is what English actually do.
